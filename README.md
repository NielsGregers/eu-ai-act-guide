# EU AI Act Guide

A comprehensive guide to understanding Europe's first regulatory framework for artificial intelligence. This educational resource was created to help understand the European Union's AI Act, its implementation timeline, risk categories, and compliance requirements.

## About This Project

This guide was purely AI-generated based on inspiration from dialogue at a meeting regarding the EU AI Act, with prompts curated by Niels Gregers Johansen. It serves as an educational demonstration of how AI can be used to create informative content about regulatory frameworks.

The entire site was built through a series of prompts and iterations using v0, Vercel's AI-powered assistant, showcasing the capabilities of AI in creating educational content and functional web applications.

## Features

- **Timeline Visualization**: Interactive timeline showing the EU AI Act implementation stages
- **Risk Categories Explanation**: Detailed breakdown of prohibited, high-risk, limited-risk, and minimal-risk AI systems
- **Compliance Checklist**: Interactive checklist with Excel export functionality
- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step guide for implementing EU AI Act requirements
- **Visual Risk Matrix**: Visual representation of risk levels and regulatory burden

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- XLSX library for Excel exports
- Vercel Analytics
- Microsoft Clarity for user behavior tracking
